    <h1>WELCOME TO MY PROFILE</h1>
    <p>

        Hello! My name is Sireesha palla. I recently graduated with a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) from PBR Visvodaya Institute of Technology & Science  in 2023. While my core background is in ECE, I have always been captivated by the world of software development. Recognizing this passion, I pursued a comprehensive course in full stack web development, where I acquired skills in both frontend and backend technologies.
In this course, I mastered a variety of technologies, including C, Java, HTML5,CSS3,My SQL, Java script, JDBC, React, Node.js, Data structures, enabling me to design and build seamless, user-centric web applications. My academic background in ECE provides me with a unique perspective, helping me approach problem-solving in software development from a holistic viewpoint. This combination of skills not only makes me proficient in developing web applications but also gives me the capability to integrate and work on embedded web interfaces and IoT applications.
I am actively seeking opportunities in the software industry, where I can apply my diverse skill set, contribute to innovative projects, and continue to learn and grow as a professional. I believe that my unique blend of ECE knowledge and full-stack development skills can offer a fresh perspective to any team. I am eager to work in a challenging environment, collaborate with like-minded professionals, and drive success through my contributions.
Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of joining your team.
