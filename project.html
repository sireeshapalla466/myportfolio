    <h2>SUBSTRATE INTEGRATED WAVEGUIDE DUAL BAND
        BANDPASS FILTER DESIGN USING CSRR</h2>
        <p>
            Now a days most of the technologies are looking to reduce the size and cost ofcomponent to make it easy to integrate with 
components and use them in real time applications.But the conventional microwave components which are heavy, bulky in size, high cost. 
In order to overcome these drawbacks we have chosen substrate integrated waveguide as an approach.In order to archive these advantages
substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) is the most promising candidate for the implementation of millimeter-wave integrated circuits and 
systems for the next decade. Based on planar dielectric substrates with top and bottom metal layers perforated with metalized holes, 
SIW structures offer a compact, low loss, flexible, and cost-effective solution for integrating active circuits, passive components and
radiating elements on the same substrate.
        </p>
<h3>These are the final design of our project</h3>
